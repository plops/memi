%  The objective is defined by its NA and its refractive index n, with
%  NA=n*sin(alpha). The sample distance in real space must be at least
%  dx=1/kxmax and dz=1/dkz if electric fields should be represented
%  without aliasing. We are interested in the intensity in real
%  space. Its calculation is a convolution in Fourierspace, making a
%  donut out of the sphere cap that is twice as wide and twice as
%  high. The sampling in real space should therefore be dx=1/(2*kxmax)
%  and dz=1/(2*dkz).

%  Looking at the right image we see: sin(alpha)=kxmax/k. Therefore we
%  have: kxmax=NA*k/n. We further know k=n/lambda, so we have:
%  kxmax=NA/lambda.

%  We can also express kz with alpha: cos(alpha)=kz/k. Using
%  cos(asin(x))=sqrt(1-x^2) we find:
%  dkz=k-k*cos(alpha)=(n-sqrt(n^2-NA^2))/lambda.

%  With NA=1.38, n=1.515 and lambda=.5 um we obtain: dx=181nm and
%  dz=281nm. Lets further set the size of the calculation domain to
%  s=256. Then the (rectangular) field is xmax=dx*s=46um wide in real
%  space. The diameter r of the back focal plane for this calculation
%  parameters would be 128 pixels.

%  To define all the parameters of the simulation, we start in the
%  BFP. We choose s, the width (and height) of the calculation
%  domain. On this array we determine kx and ky such, that kx=0 in the
%  center and kx=2*kxmax on the right border. For each of these points
%  we can calculate kz=sqrt(k-(kx^2+ky^2)). These choices inherently
%  define the width of the field in sample space. If we want to
%  simulate a bigger field of view we have to increase s. Note: one
%  could reduce kx on the border to kxmax (instead of 2*kxmax) but we
%  need some padding there. Otherwise artefacts due to aliasing will
%  deteriorate results.


%  Lets look at the simplest model of the MEMI system:

% Lenses are drawn like this: |
%  		      	      v

% Front and back focal planes of neighboring lenses coincide.  Note:
% The focal lengths are different for each lens. In the simulation we
% account for that by changing the scale factor for each of the planes
% (i.e. what is the size of one pixel in the real world in this
% plane).

% Example: The focal length of the tubelens can be adjusted between
% 224mm to 448mm. To what size is the field of 46um magnified for a
% choice of 224mm and a 63x objective? The focal length of the
% objective with standard Zeiss tubelength fobj=164.5/63=2.6. The size
% of the 256x256 array in the LCOS plane is therefore:
% 0.046*224/2.6=3.9mm. Note: increasing s (from 256) will increase the
% size of the simulated LCOS.

% In this model the MMA and LCOS are assumed to be transmissive
% devices.

% To simulate the MEMI system for incoherent light we sum the
% intensity images of many coherent beams in sample space, i.e. we put
% a laser point source (think of mono mode fiber) plane
% 'angle'. Ideally we would do one simulation for each of the 256x256
% pixels in the calculation domain 'angle'. Probably we can limit
% ourselves to pixels that are image points of bright regions on the
% LCOS. Assuming the the MMA contains only one small 'hole' (bright
% region) - which is the standard operation condition of our device -
% we can reduce the number of pixels in 'angle' even more. For a small
% transmissive region of the MMA the image of the laser spot from
% angle will be blurred and illuminate several pixels on the LCOS. So
% we will not need to run simulations for neighboring pixels in
% 'angle'.

% Example: A gaussian with spot width = 8 pixels in the MMA plane,
% leads to a spot width of 10.2 pixels in the LCOS plane:

% s=[256 256];
% r=8;
% mma=exp(-rr(s).^2/r^2);
% lcos=exp(-rr(s).^2/(256/(pi*r))^2);
% lcos-real(ft(mma))/max(real(ft(mma))) % is practially zero

% For this example it would be sufficient to run 25x25 coherent
% propagations, if the full LCOS is transparent. In a real example the
% LCOS image will be sparse as well, reducing the necessary number of
% coherent propagations even more.

% Refocusing: When the following circular symmetric phase function is
% multiplied to the complex field distribution in the pupil plane,
% images at planes other than the focus can be calculated.
% exp(kz_of_kxky(:,:)*(1i*k/dx*Dz)); The defocus Dz is given in the
% same coordinates as dx. We would like to calculate the defocus up to
% 40 um deep, so that we can predict the light intensity into the
% deepest layer of the embryo. However even for Dz=3um the phase is
% highly oszillatory and s would have to be increased to sufficiently
% sample the term. The reason for that is that the high NA objective
% sends light under a steep angle through the sample, the further out
% of focus, the bigger the computational domain needs to be.


% YYYY now I'm confused, I get good results even if the thing isn't
% YYYY sampled correctly :-). But why?
% ----------------
% XXXX That would be nice but it obviously doesn't work when I try it:
% XXXX The phase is the sphere cap, therefore the sampling has to
% XXXX increase quadratic with defocus. It more looks like 2048 is
% XXXX sufficient to propagate 4um (!) :-( and 256 propagates 0.84um. 
% -------------------
% XXXX Example: Increasing s to 2048 results in a field width of 371um,
% XXXX corresponding taking into account the 65.6 degree half angle of the
% XXXX objective, this leads to tan(alpha)=(371/2)/h -> h=409um.  A domain
% XXXX size s=975 is sufficient to propagate 40um deep.

% XXXX Probably wrong:
% -------------------
% XXXX If the computational domain isn't properly increased the aliasing
% XXXX effects of the fourier transform effectively work as though the
% XXXX computational domain was surrounded by a perfect mirror.

% Perhaps this problem could also be solved using more sophisticated
% beam propagation code with perfectly matched layers on the border to
% absorb diverging light.

The maximum difference is 5.18% but one can see the diffraction
pattern of the disk rasterizing the LCOS. Probably the sampling has to
be increased. Assuming the pattern doesn't affect out-of-focus slices
very much (good approximation as the pattern is out of focus) then we
can take a look at the intensity distribution in those slices: The
disk shows a bit more energy in higher angles.

I conclude: gray values for the mma are not necessary.
